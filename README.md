Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic way of coming up with a high quality software using the application of engineering principles,methods and tools to ensure its development and maintanenance.
The importance of software engineering is that,it plays a crucial role in enabling the creation of software application and systems that powers various aspects of modern life.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.In 1948,the first compiler which translates human readable code and into machine code was developed by Grace Hopper.
2.In 1957,the first high level programming language known as Fortran was released.
3.In 1970s,new methodologies were developed including structured programming and object oriented programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
1.Requirements-This is the gathering and documentation of the user needs and system requirements.
2.Design-This is the creating of high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation-This involves the writing of code and building a software according to the desgn specification.
4.Testing-This is where various tests are conducted to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5.Deployment-This is where the software is released to the users or customers.
6.Maintenance-This is whereby the developer provides ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards,for example:a car manufacturing company requires a sytematic way in which sytems are developed and instelled, while, agile methodology is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration,and responding to change:for example,development of a new website for an IT company.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software developer-The software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2.Quality Assurance Engineer-He\she ensures the software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3.Project manager-A project manager oversees the planning.execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The integrated development enviroments aids by providing a comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code,for example:Eclipse
The Version Contol Systems are tools used for tracking changes to source code and cordinate work among team members,for example:GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges faced include:
1.Changing requirements-This is where requirements change during the development cycle resulting to project delays
2.Tight deadlines- This whereby the pressure to deliver the software products can result to compromised quality
3.Technical debt-This is from using shortcuts and suboptimal solutions  which can impede the future.
Stragies that can be used include:
1.Use of agile methodologies
2.Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
3.Effective communication.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing-This the testing of individual components or modules of software.
2.Intergration testing-This is testing between different components or subsystems.
3.System testing- This is the testing of the entire software.
4.Acceptance testing-This is the testing of the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

The importance of softtware quality assurance is to ensure that the software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models.
The importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models is that it ensures answers are clear and specific.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt-Write a C.V
An improved prompt-I am a proffesional lawyer,with 3 years of experience.Write a c.v for a role of a prosecuter in the high court of Kenya. 
The improved prompt clearly defines the role and the AI will therefore craft a c.v. specialized for the role we want.
